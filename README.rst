smarties
**********

**smarties is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) software designed with the following
objectives**

- high-performance C++ implementations of [Remember and Forget for Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05827) and other deep RL learning algorithms including V-RACER, CMA, PPO, DQN, DPG, ACER, and NAF.

- the environment application determines at runtime the properties of the control problem to be solved. For example, the number of the agents in the environment, whether they are solving the same problem (and therefore they should all contribute to learning a common policy) or they are solving different problems (e.g. competing or collaborating). The properties of each agent's state and action spaces. Whether one or more agents are dealing with a partially-observable problem, which causes the learners to automatically use recurrent networks for function approximation. Whether the observation has to be preprocessed by convolutional layers and the properties thereof.

- the environment application is in control of the learning progress. More specifically, smarties supports applications whose API design is similar to that of OpenAI gym, where the environment is a self-contained function to be called to receive a new observation and advance the simulation in time. However, smarties also supports a more realistic API where the environment simulation dominates the structure of the application code. In this setting, it is the RL code that is called whenever new observations are available and require the agent to pick an action.

- the environment application determines the  computational resources available to train and run simulations, with support for distributed (MPI) codebases.

- minimally intrusive plug-in API that can be inserted into C++, python and Fortran simulation software.

Install
======

Regardless of OS, smarties relies on pybind11 for the Python interface. Therefore, to enable compilation of smarties with Python environment simulation codebases:

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install pybind11 --user

Moreover, after the compilation steps for either Linux or Mac OS, add the path to the smarties library directory to your dynamic loader:

.. code:: shell

    echo 'export SMARTIES_ROOT=/path/to/smarties/folder/' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export PATH=${SMARTIES_ROOT}/bin:${PATH}' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${SMARTIES_ROOT}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}' >> ~/.bash_profile

The environment variable ``SMARTIES_ROOT`` is used to compile most of the applications in the 'apps' folder.

Linux
------

Smarties requires gcc version 6.1 or greater, a thread-safe (at least ``MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED``) implementation of MPI, and a serial BLAS implementation with CBLAS interface. Furthermore, in order to test on the benchmark problems, OpenAI gym or the DeepMind Control Suite with python>=3.5. MPI and OpenBLAS can be installed by running the ``install_dependencies.sh`` script.

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/cselab/smarties.git
    cd smarties
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j

Mac OS
------
Installation on Mac OS is a bit more laborious due to to the LLVM compiler provided by Apple not supporting OpenMP threads. First, install the required dependencies as:

.. code:: shell

    brew install llvm libomp open-mpi openblas

Now, we have to switch from Apple's LLVM compiler to the most recent LLVM compiler as default for the user's shell:

.. code:: shell

    echo "alias cc='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang'" >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo "alias gcc='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang'" >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo "alias g++='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++'" >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo "alias c++='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++'" >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo "export PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:\${PATH}" >> ~/.bash_profile

Then we are ready to get and install smarties:

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/cselab/smarties.git
    cd smarties/makefiles
    make -j


User code samples
=================

C++
-----
The basic structure of a C++ based application for smarties is structured as:

.. code:: shell

    #include "smarties.h"
    
    inline void app_main(smarties::Communicator*const comm, int argc, char**argv)
    {
      comm->setStateActionDims(state_dimensionality, action_dimensionality);
      Environment env;
    
      while(true) { //train loop
        env.reset(comm->getPRNG()); // prng with different seed on each process
        comm->sendInitState(env.getState()); //send initial state
    
        while (true) { //simulation loop
          std::vector<double> action = comm->recvAction();
          bool isTerminal = env.advance(action); //advance the simulation:
    
          if(isTerminal) { //tell smarties that this is a terminal state
            comm->sendTermState(env.getState(), env.getReward());
            break;
          } else  # normal state
            comm->sendState(env.getState(), env.getReward());
        }
      }
    }
    
    int main(int argc, char**argv)
    {
      smarties::Engine e(argc, argv);
      if( e.parse() ) return 1;
      e.run( app_main );
      return 0;
    }

For compilation, the following flags should be set in order for the compiler to find smarties:

.. code:: shell

    LDFLAGS="-L${SMARTIES_ROOT}/lib -lsmarties"
    CPPFLAGS="-I${SMARTIES_ROOT}/include"


Python  
-----
smarties uses pybind11 for seamless compatibility with python. The structure of the environment application is almost the same as the C++ version:

.. code:: shell

    import smarties as rl
    
    def app_main(comm):
      comm.setStateActionDims(state_dimensionality, action_dimensionality)
      env = Environment()
    
      while 1: #train loop
        env.reset() # (slightly) random initial conditions are best
        comm.sendInitState(env.getState())
    
        while 1: #simulation loop
          action = comm.recvAction()
          isTerminal = env.advance(action)
    
          if terminated:  # tell smarties that this is a terminal state
            comm.sendTermState(env.getState(), env.getReward())
            break
          else: # normal state
            comm.sendState(env.getState(), env.getReward())
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
      e = rl.Engine(sys.argv)
      if( e.parse() ): exit()
      e.run( app_main )


Code examples
--------------
The ``apps`` folder contains a number of examples showing the various use-cases of smarties. Each folder contains the files required to define and run a different application. While it is generally possible to run each case as ``./exec`` or ``./exec.py``, smarties will create a number of log files, simulation folders and restart files. Therefore it is recommended to manually create a run directory or use the launch scripts contained in the ``launch`` directory.

The applications that are already included are:

- ``apps/cart_pole_cpp``: simple C++ example of a cart-pole balancing problem  

- ``apps/cart_pole_py``: simple python example of a cart-pole balancing problem  

- ``apps/cart_pole_f90``: simple fortran example of a cart-pole balancing problem  

- ``apps/cart_pole_many``: example of two cart-poles that define different decision processes: one performs the opposite of the action sent by smarties and the other hides some of the state variables from the learner (partially observable) and tehrefore requires recurrent networks.  

- ``apps/cart_pole_distribEnv``: example of a distributed environment which requires MPI. The application requests M ranks to run each simulation. If the executable is ran as ``mpirun -n N exec``, (N-1)/M teams of processes will be created, each with its own MPI communicator. Each simulation process contains one or more agents.  

- ``apps/cart_pole_distribAgent``: example of a problem where the agent themselves are distributed. Meaning that the agents exist across the team of processes that run a simulation and get the same action to perform. For example flow actuation problems where there is only one control variable (eg. some inflow parameter), but the entire simulation requires multiple CPUs to run.  

- ``apps/predator_prey``: example of agents competing.  

- ``apps/glider``: example of an ODE-based control problem that requires precise controls, used for the paper [Deep-Reinforcement-Learning for Gliding and Perching Bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03671)  

- ``apps/func_maximization/``: example of function fitting and maximization, most naturally approached with CMA.  

- ``apps/OpenAI_gym``: code to run most gym application, including the MuJoCo based robotic benchmarks shown in [Remember and Forget for Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05827)  

- ``apps/OpenAI_gym_atari``: code to run the Atari games, which automatically creates the required convolutional pre-processing  

- ``apps/Deepmind_control``: code to run the Deepmind Control Suite control problems

- ``apps/CUP2D_2fish``: and similarly named applications require `CubismUP 2D <https://github.com/novatig/CubismUP_2D>`_.

Launching
=========

In many cases it is possible to launch an application compiled with smarties simple as, for example:

.. code:: shell

    ./exec [args...]

The script ``smarties.py`` is provided to allow greater flexibility, to ease  
passing options to smarties, and to help setting up MPI-based training processes.  
For example, to have multiple processes running the environment (distributed  
data-collection) or multiple processes hosting the RL algorithms (distributed SGD).

With the ``bin`` directory added to the shell ``PATH``, the description of the  
setup options are printed out by typing:

.. code:: shell

    smarties.py --help

The script takes 2 (optional) positional arguments, for example:

.. code:: shell

    smarties.py cart_pole_py VRACER.json

In this case, smarties will train with the V-RACER algorithm, and hyper-parameters  
defined in the ``VRACER.json`` file found in the ``SMARTIES_ROOT/settings`` directory  
on the application ``cart_pole_py`` found in the ``SMARTIES_ROOT/apps`` folder.  
All output files will be saved in the current directory. 
If no arguments are provided, the script will look for an executable (named  
``exec`` or ``exec.py`` in the current directory or whatever specified with the  
``--execname exec`` option) and will use default hyper-parameters.

Most useful options:  

* ``--gym`` to tell smarties to run OpenAI gym applications (eg. ``smarties.py Walker2d-v2 --gym``)

* ``--atari`` to tell smarties to run OpenAI gym Atari applications. For example,  ``smarties.py Pong --atari`` will run the ``PongNoFrameskip-v4`` environment with DQN-like preprocessing conv2d layers as specified by ``apps/OpenAI_gym_atari/exec.py``.

* ``--dmc`` to tell smarties to run DeepMind Control Suite applications. For example,  ``smarties.py "acrobot swingup" --dmc`` will run the ``acrobot`` environment with task ``swingup``.

* ``--runname RUNNAME`` will execute the training run from folder ``RUNNAME`` and create all output and setup files therein. The path of the folder is by default ``SMARTIES_ROOT/runs/RUNNAME``, but may be modified for example as ``--runprefix ./``, which will create ``RUNNAME`` in the current directory.  

* ``--nEvalSeqs N`` tells smarties that it should evaluate and not modify an already trained policy for ``N`` sequences (the smarties-generated restart files should be already located in the run directory or at path ``--restart /path/to/restart/``).

* ``--args "arg1 arg2 ..`` in order to pass line arguments to the application.

* ``--nEnvironments N`` will spawn ``N`` processes running environment simulations. If the environment requires (or benefits from) one or more dedicated MPI ranks (recommended for clusters and expensive simulations) this can be set with ``--mpiProcsPerEnv M``. In this case, 1+N*M MPI processes will run the training: one learner and N teams of M processes to handle the N simulations. If the network update needs to be parallelized (distributed SGD), use the option ``--nLearners K``. 

Note for evaluating trained policies. For safety, use the option ``--restart`` or copy all the ``agent_[...].raw`` files onto a new folder in order to not overwrite any file of the training directory. Make sure the policy is read correctly (eg. if code was compiled with different features or run with different algorithms)  comparing the ``restarted_[...]`` files and the originals (e.g. ``diff /path/eval/run/restarted_agent_00_net_weights.raw /path/train/run/agent_00_net_weights.raw``).

Outputs and postprocessing
==========================

* Running the script will produce the following outputs on screen (also backed up into the files ``agent_%02d_stats.txt``). According to applicability, these are either statistics computed over the past 1000 steps or are the most recent values:

    - ``ID``: Learner identifier. If a single environment contains multiple agents, and if each agent requires a different policy, then we distinguish outputs pertinent to each agent with this ID integer.
    - ``#/1e3``: Counter of gradient steps divided by 1000
    - ``avgR | stdr | DKL``: Average **cumulative** reward among stored episodes, standard dev of the distribution of **instantaneous** rewards, and average Kullback Leibler divergence of experiences in the Memory Buffer w.r.t. current policy.
    - ``nEp |  nObs | totEp | totObs | oldEp | nFarP``: Number of episodes and observations in the Replay Memory. Total ep/obs since beginning of training passing through the buffer. Time stamp of the oldest episode (more precisely, of the last observation of the episode) that is currently in the buffer. Number of far-policy samples in the buffer.
    - ``net`` and/or ``policy`` and/or ``critic`` and/or ``input`` and/or other: L2 norm of the weights of the corresponding network approximator.
    - ``RMSE | avgQ | stdQ | minQ | maxQ``: RMSE of Q (or V) approximator, its average value, standard deviation, min and max.
    - (if algorithm employs parameterized policy) ``polG | penG | proj`` Average norm of the policy gradient and that of the penalization gradient (if applicable). Third is the average projection of the policy gradient over the penalty one. I.e. the average value of ``proj = polG \cdot penG / sqrt(penG \cdot penG)``. ``proj`` should generally be negative: current policy should be moved away from past behavior in the direction of pol grad.
    - (extra outputs depending on algorithms) In RACER/DPG: ``beta`` is the weight between penalty and policy gradients. ``avgW`` is the average value of the off policy importance weight ``pi/mu``. ``dAdv`` is the average change of the value of the Retrace estimator for a state-action pair between two consecutive times the pair was sampled for learning. In PPO: ``beta`` is the coefficient of the penalty gradient. ``DKL`` is the average Kullback Leibler of the 'proximally' on-policy samples used to compute updates. ``avgW`` is the average value of ``pi/mu``. ``DKLt`` is the target value of Kullback Leibler if algorithm is trying to learn a value for it.

* The file ``agent_%02d_rank%02d_cumulative_rewards.dat`` contains the all-important cumulative rewards. It is stored as text-columns specifying: gradient count, time step count, agent id, episode length (in time steps), sum of rewards over the episode. The first two values are recorded when the last observation of the episode has been recorded. Can be plotted with the script ``smarties_plot_rew.py`` script (eg. the figure on the left above). ``smarties_plot_rew.py`` accepts a list of run directories and optional arguments explained by ``marties_plot_rew.py --help``.


* If data logging was not disabled (option ``--disableDataLogging`` for ``smarties.py``), a complete log of all state/action/rewards/policies will be stored in binary files named ``agent_02d_rank%02d_obs.raw``. These can be plotted by the script ``smarties_plot_obs.py`` (eg. the figure on the right above). The help message is straightforward. 

* The files named ``agent_%02d_${network_name}_${SPEC}.raw`` contain back-ups of network weights (``weights``), Adam's moments estimates (``1stMom`` and ``2ndMom``) and target weights (``tgt_weights``) at regularly spaced time stamps. Some insight into the shape of the weight vector can be obtained by plotting with the script ``smarties_plot_weights.py``. The files ending in ``scaling.raw`` contain the values used to rescale the states and rewards. Specifically, one after the other, 3 arrays of size ``d_S`` of the state-values means, 1/stdev, and stdev, followed by one value corresponding to 1/stdev of the rewards.

* The files ``agent_%02d_${network_name}_grads.raw`` record the statistics (mean, standard deviation) of the gradients received by each network output. Can be plotted with ``smarties_plot_grads.py``.

* Various files ending in ``.log``. These record the state of smarties on startup. They include: ``gitdiff.log`` records the changes wrt the last commit, ``gitlog.log`` records the last commits, ``out.log`` is a copy of the screen output, and ``problem_size.log`` records state/action sizes used by other scripts.
